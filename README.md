# Economic Data Sources

## Overview

This repository offers a programmatic way to interact with various economic data sources using popular programming languages such as `R` and `Python`

## Features

- Functions to access different data sources easily
- support for `R` and `Python`
- user written functions, I try not to use existing packages and/or libraries as they sometimes stop working as soon as the developer stops supporting them
- There are several awesome packages already developed:
